Scratch Hue Extension
---------------------

This package provides a helper app to allow the Scratch 2 Offline Editor to 
control a set of Philips Hue lights. Currently, only three lights are supported,
but more could be added  by configuration if necessary.

Instructions for running a helper app are at http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/w/images/ExtensionsDoc.HTTP-9-11.pdf.
